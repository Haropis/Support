      My name is Oluwapelumi Adegboyega. I am a student, graphic designer, writer, mobigrapher and web-developer from Ogun, Nigeria. I need finances for schooling and have decided to situate myself in a position wherein I can work to actualize my dreams as I would rather love to setup my own business now and position myself to be able to work out my finances later on than to have to always ask people for little funds anytime I need it.</p>
      <p>I have been designing for a couple years and have worked with several brands but I had always borrowed the gadgets I used from friends and now have nothing to turn to for my own projects. Your domations would go a long way in procuring my own devices for work and learning (a good smartphone , a good laptop, a few printers, a shop, and anything else that can be gotten from it).
